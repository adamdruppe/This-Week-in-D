=== BIGGER LONG TERM STUFF ===

DConf special edition is probably going to be a bit of a blow-out
and we can talk about dconf for weeks later too. I should ask
the speakers to summarize their stuff and I can see about writing
it as the conference is ongoing.

Maybe right before DConf 2015, we'll do a look back at DConf 2014
as a special section too. "This week, we're preparing for DConf so
let's take this opportunity to talk about the previous ones!")

=== BACKLOG ===

Tip ideas:

Orvid_: "Remember, `foreach (dchar c; str)` and `foreach (c; str)` do different things?" 
	* auto decoding in phobos too

sleek: uniform function call syntax is a fun one
	* I can talk about the encapsulation thing and prolly mention
	what `private` means too while I'm at it.

html parsing - the C++ link extraction thread and dom.d
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27943342/how-to-extract-only-first-match-with-regexp/27947350#27947350

Actually, I think HTML counts as a bit of a FAQ, maybe I'll put
it in there and then save room for other things.

Project spotlights:

I can talk about a LOT of my stuff for a long time
	dom.d
	http2.d
	simpledisplay.d + simpleaudio.d + joystick.d
	jsvar.d
	database.d
	cgi.d

	the list goes on. And my larger projects like terminalemulator
	and inspector or the taskbar could be in too.
