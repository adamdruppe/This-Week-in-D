write about changes in TWID and attitudes of humility on asking questions







 mixin BitPack!( typeof( { struct Data { @PackSize( 2 ) int foo; @PackSize( 5 ) int bar; } return Data.init; }() ) );


write about mental friction



Making a ref range out of as tring so oyu can do splitter
and see the remaining stuff when you are done.

arrays ARE ranges


and dconf too.

voldemort type to pass anonymous struct as template param:

foo!({

 template isPure(Func, Args...) { alias isPure = is(typeof((){void _() pure {Func(Args);}}))); }


return Nullable!int(); // this works

opApply, ref arguments, and overloads.

or that to eb considered

FILE ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS:
	* disable copying on all ranges
	* allow disabling assignment on classes too


DCONF

We also were asked about the alias template arguments with basic types.




(16:22:32) andralex: CyberShadow: around?
(16:24:28) CyberShadow: Hi andralex
(16:24:30) CyberShadow: How are you?
(16:24:41) andralex: CyberShadow: better than yesterday :)
(16:24:49) andralex: CyberShadow: you?
(16:24:51) CyberShadow: I'm good
(16:24:55) andralex: awes
(16:24:55) andralex: well
(16:24:57) CyberShadow: Got work for me?
(16:25:06) andralex: well, not work
(16:25:08) andralex: but FUN!
(16:25:16) CyberShadow: I'm listening :)
(16:25:19) andralex: I’m off the phone with Walter
(16:25:27) andralex: and we got to a compromise
(16:25:52) andralex: so, here’s what would be great if you could lead
(16:26:06) andralex: 1. Collect all names ADDED to Phobos since 2.067
(16:26:20) andralex: these are names that we have ONE shot in eternity to get right before they’re frozen
(16:26:47) andralex: 2. Lead a community discussion on choosing the most palatable names
(16:27:08) andralex: 3. We freeze those names in 2.068 and there’s no more discussion about them
(16:27:22) CyberShadow: Sounds like a plan
(16:27:29) andralex: What we want to make sure is that existing names are improved continuously and disruptively
(16:27:42) andralex: for new names, we agree to have one good shake of the stick before freezing them
(16:27:46) andralex: CyberShadow: are you up for this?
(16:28:06) CyberShadow: You mean existing names are not changed disruptively?
(16:28:16) andralex: yes, we want to avoid that
(16:28:25) andralex: barring exceptional circumstances such as TypeTuple
(16:28:48) CyberShadow: Sounds good, let's do it
(16:28:55) andralex: so… there’s choice in changing the not-yet-release names, but NOT in new sweeping naming conventions that mess up everything
(16:28:56) andralex: yay
(16:29:12) andralex: CyberShadow: let’s 
(16:29:13) andralex: thx!
(16:29:25) andralex: I’m back to allocator then

=== BIGGER LONG TERM STUFF ===

DConf special edition is probably going to be a bit of a blow-out
and we can talk about dconf for weeks later too. I should ask
the speakers to summarize their stuff and I can see about writing
it as the conference is ongoing.

Maybe right before DConf 2015, we'll do a look back at DConf 2014
as a special section too. "This week, we're preparing for DConf so
let's take this opportunity to talk about the previous ones!")

=== BACKLOG ===

Tip ideas:

Orvid_: "Remember, `foreach (dchar c; str)` and `foreach (c; str)` do different things?" 
	* auto decoding in phobos too

	what `private` means too while I'm at it.

Project spotlights:


http://forum.dlang.org/thread/pxqytmikgipfjkjexuux@forum.dlang.org?page=12#post-kxoaqsnpapopkxommajg:40forum.dlang.org

I can talk about a LOT of my stuff for a long time
	dom.d
	http2.d
	simpledisplay.d + simpleaudio.d + joystick.d
	jsvar.d
	database.d
	cgi.d

	the list goes on. And my larger projects like terminalemulator
	and inspector or the taskbar could be in too.
